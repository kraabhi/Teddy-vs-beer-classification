This dataset is created for reference by downloading dataset from google and convert itinto classification problem.

First insert name in google search engine and you get lots of images. press ctrl+shift+j (for windows user) and you will be directed to page where you need to paste 
following : urls=Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.rg_i')).map(el=> el.hasAttribute('data-src')?el.getAttribute('data-src'):el.getAttribute('data-iurl'));
window.open('data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,' + escape(urls.join('\n'))); 
Press enter and all the image urls will be downloaded. you can use them as csv files. do this for all the classes you want to work for classification.

Create folder name beer and create subdirectories by categories downloaded. Upload urls in respective sub directories.

There is special function in fast.ai to download images from urls directly by giving source and destination path.
download_images(path/file, dest, max_pics=200). Here first argument is path of urls csv and sec argument is destination where downloaded images to be saved.

this is performed for all categories.

Now we can go ahead to create databrunch and see data.
